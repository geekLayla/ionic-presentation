<h2>The Downsides of Native apps</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Proficiency in each platform required</li>
	<li>Entirely separate code bases</li>
	<li>Timely expensive development</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
Although native apps have all these pros, they have also some cons:

Since we develop for a specific plateform, native apps are more costly due to high mantenance of multiple codes bases.
They require more developers with experience in each plateform to maintain.
