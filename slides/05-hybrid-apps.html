In fact, yes there's what we call hybrid apps.

Hybrid apps are essentially web apps embedded into a mobile native app through some tools.
Just like native apps, hybrid apps can use operating system features such as camera and GPS...
They are developed using web technologies
and the most important they excute a single code base regardless of the plateform in which they run
What we call develop once, run everywhere spirit
