	Hybrid apps are essentially websites embedded in a mobile app through what we call a webview. They are developed using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, and execute the same code regardless of the platform in which they run. They can, with tools like PhoneGap and Cordova, use the native features of a device, like GPS or camera.

	What about Ionic Native you’re asking? Don’t be mistaken by the name. Ionic Native is a new name for what used to be called ngCordova. It’s simply the new Ionic way to use existing Cordova and PhoneGap plugins. Ionic Native will not make your app native.

	Write once, run everywhere
