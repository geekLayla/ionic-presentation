hooks: custom actions to be taken as your app moves through the Cordova development process.
Plugins cordova plugins that you add to your project
SCSS app’s SASS file.defaults styles to change easily.
WWW is where your app is developed and where you’ll spend most of your time when building an Ionic app.
LIB is where Ionic and any other libraries you use can be placed.
 
How you should organize your app’s file structure is debatable, and with practice, you’ll find a structure that works best for you.
By default, Ionic organizes your app in to a series of directories: css, img, js, lib, and templates. 
As you develop your app, you may feel that this structure is no longer appropriate.
It may make sense to separate your app in to logical chunks. Maybe you have a product list, product search, and user section of your app.
It may be appropriate to break your app up in to folders for each section, and each would have their own controller and template files.
A great guide to follow is from John Papa’s Angular Application Structure.
