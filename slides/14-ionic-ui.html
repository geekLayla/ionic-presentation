<h3>Ionic Built-in UI components</h3>

<aside class="notes">
	Working with Ionic is a bit like working with a CSS framework like Bootstrap. It comes with lots of components that are pre-made and pre-styled. You want to display a list of items, and for each you need an avatar, a little description, and a date? Done, they have a component for that!

	A typical hybrid app will run the same code regardless of the platform, and that is what Ionic is capable of doing. However, in order to feel more “native”, Ionic will adapt a few of its behaviors according to the platform. If you use tabs, they will be displayed just as recommended by the platform—at the bottom of the screen in iOS, and at top in Android.
