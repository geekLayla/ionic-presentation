	&ldquo;So have you ever created a native app?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
In fact Native apps are application that we can download from an app store (Google Play for android, AppStore for ios)
we install the app, then we get a shortcut in the home page of our devices.

Native apps are developed in the language required by the platform it targets, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, Java for Android, etc..

Because native apps are developed for a specific plateform, they can interact easily and take advantages of the operating system features and all other softwares that are typically installed on that plateform. They can access GPS, camera, contacts...etc  without any restriction.
They achieve good performance
and they give a beautifull user experiences.
