	&ldquo;So have you ever created a native app?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
	Native apps are developed in the language required by the platform it targets, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, Java for Android, etc. The code written is not shared across platforms and their behavior varies. They have direct access to all features offered by the platform without any restriction.
